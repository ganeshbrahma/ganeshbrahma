## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Ganesh Brahma**, a certified Azure Data Engineer with 4+ years of experience building robust, scalable, and cloud-native data solutions. I specialize in designing and optimizing big data pipelines using **Spark**, **Azure**, and **AWS** technologies to solve high-volume data challenges in the healthcare and retail sectors.

- 💼 **Associate Data Engineer @ Cognizant** — Developed and optimized ETL pipelines for 200M+ records, reduced workflow runtimes by 50%, and led cloud migration from Cloudera to Azure.
- 🛒 **Freelance @ Applaudo (Walmart)** — Migrated large-scale pipelines from BigQuery to Spark on GCP with 40% runtime improvement.
- ✈️ Built real-time streaming systems using Spark, Sqoop, and Hadoop for aviation analytics.
- 📦 Skilled in **Databricks**, **Azure Data Factory**, **Hive**, **Scala**, **PySpark**, and **Cloud DevOps (CI/CD, Git, Jenkins)**.
- 📨 Creator of **MailMatrix** – a serverless bulk email dispatch system on AWS.
- 🧠 Passionate about clean code, performance tuning, and cloud-native solutions

I love transforming raw data into actionable insights through efficient architecture and clean engineering practices. Currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at the **University of Central Missouri**, expected in 2025.
